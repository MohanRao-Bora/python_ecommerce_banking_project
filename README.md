# Python E-Commerce & Banking CLI Application

A project simulating a full e-commerce workflow (`main.py`) and a standalone banking system (`banking_main.py`), which are integrated to handle real-time payments and refunds.

---

## Key Features ‚ú®

#### Sales Module (`main.py`)
* **Full E-Commerce Workflow:** Complete user journey from registration and login to product browsing, cart management, and a secure checkout.
* **Order Management:** Customers can view their order history, check automated shipment statuses, and view detailed invoices.
* **Customer Interaction:** A full review system allows customers to leave ratings and comments for products they have purchased.
* **Cancellations & Returns:** Logic for customers to cancel or return orders, triggering automated refunds and product restocking.

#### Banking Module (`banking_main.py`)
* **Account Management:** Ability for users to create and manage their own bank accounts (Savings & Current).
* **Core Banking Operations:** Supports key features like depositing money, viewing transaction history, and managing beneficiaries.
* **Fund Transfers:** Allows for secure, interactive fund transfers between customers within the banking system.

#### System Integration
* The sales module securely authenticates with the banking module to process real-time payments and automated refunds without storing sensitive banking links in the sales database.
